    '6000One' is my nicname, it is made by my colleague when I served for Korean army,
    because it is pronounced similarly with my real name in Korean.
    I was born in small town of Korea, near by Deagu. and graduated University placed on there.
    I like reading books and learning new ones. Now, I'm fall into learning English and coding.
